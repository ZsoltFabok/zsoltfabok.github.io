Scrum, Kanban, and Lean are very good at improving processes, which we need for fast delivery, and Agile/Lean UX to find the right product to deliver, so I put emphasis on these parts.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

Let's say that you have made up your mind about what you are going to do and are about to execute your plan. There may be several courses of action for you to take at this point, and in my experience the best way is to examine the situation, look for social science studies that match the problem at hand, pick one, and carefully apply its recommendations.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

As Daniel H. Pink pointed out in his book Drive that kind of reward can kill the&nbsp;intellectual&nbsp;motivation and productivity.
