There were three talks in the morning at his company evoline&nbsp;and a fourth talk late afternoon at the local meetup group. We started the day with an introduction to Kanban, because the audience knew about Agile, but Kanban was something new, and additionally we needed it for the&nbsp;maintenance-related presentation: Kanban Basics for Beginners Revised from Zsolt Fabok After a short break we continued with a longer talk about maintenance and how to use Agile, Lean, Kanban and leadership techniques in order to stabilise a maintenance situation: Kanban Basics for Beginners Revised from Zsolt Fabok The last presentation was about how to use Agile techniques without saying Agile: Agile in Stealth Mode from Zsolt Fabok My talk at the meetup became a bit longer than I expected, but we had - at least I felt like that - a great discussion how the software development process evolved at Digital Natives - my current company - and, uniquely, we talked about what we were doing right and where we failed: Evolution of the Software Development Process at Digital Natives from Zsolt Fabok I promised a list of books worth reading.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

At that time I thought that electronic boards were evil - kill communication&nbsp;and&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;-, but I decided to give a try to their suggestion: use the physical board for tracking and collaboration, and use the electronic board for administration.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

This is a common problem, I had talked to other leaders who had the same issue, and in fact I was in a similar situation before myself.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

I've started to lead a new team with the intention to introduce Kanban in their way of working. In this post, I'm going to share the result of this introduction.

In this particular post, I'm going to talk about the latter case.
