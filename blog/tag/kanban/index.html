I started to use a portfolio Kanban board that covers the whole project, but my board is different from Pawel Brodzinski's resource oriented board:I'm using an old idea from Chris Matts - a work item is put into a column that tells us when the it is supposed to be ready -, and the idea of organisational level Kanban boards.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

For example, with a CONWIP of 6 we can have at most 6 work items between 'todo' and 'done'. Like throughtput, takt time, and flow efficiency CONWIP comes from the car manufacturing world and it was designed for a system that produces the same kind of work item over and over.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

Let's assume that you have a working pull system which means that the team members don't push the work on others, but others can take the work if they are capable to handle them (I'm not using the word free on purpose because what if somebody can work on two things in parallel).<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

It shows the elapsed time between two completely assembled cars leaving the factory floor. If the takt time is 2 hours, it means that the factory produces 12 cars a day (24h/2h = 12). With the use of takt time people in car manufacturing can detect problems in production earlier.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

I was really looking forward to this event because of two reasons: first, it was held in my hometown Miskolc, Hungary at the University where I studied and work, and second, I finally saw a chance to tell students about recent software development methods, because I knew that this topic wasn't covered in their&nbsp;curriculum.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

There were three talks in the morning at his company evoline&nbsp;and a fourth talk late afternoon at the local meetup group. We started the day with an introduction to Kanban, because the audience knew about Agile, but Kanban was something new, and additionally we needed it for the&nbsp;maintenance-related presentation: Kanban Basics for Beginners Revised from Zsolt Fabok After a short break we continued with a longer talk about maintenance and how to use Agile, Lean, Kanban and leadership techniques in order to stabilise a maintenance situation: Kanban Basics for Beginners Revised from Zsolt Fabok The last presentation was about how to use Agile techniques without saying Agile: Agile in Stealth Mode from Zsolt Fabok My talk at the meetup became a bit longer than I expected, but we had - at least I felt like that - a great discussion how the software development process evolved at Digital Natives - my current company - and, uniquely, we talked about what we were doing right and where we failed: Evolution of the Software Development Process at Digital Natives from Zsolt Fabok I promised a list of books worth reading.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>
