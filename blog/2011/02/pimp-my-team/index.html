<p>From the middle of January 2011, our organization has been working in a new structure. There were different outcomes of this change, one of them was that my former firefighting team has been dismissed, and so has the team introduced in my <a href="/blog/2010/11/kanban-nightmares/">Kanban Nightmares</a> article. This post is not about their organizational change and its effects, but about the start-up of a new team in the agile world. I’m going to launch my first series of posts in which I’m going share - because sharing is good - the life of my new team in an agile perspective.</p>

<p>The title of the article is influenced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimp_My_Ride">MTV’s Pimp My Ride</a> series, in which talented and creative <em>engineers</em> are <em>customizing</em> cars. The team members and I are the <em>engineer</em>s, and our way of working is the <em>car</em>. While watching the show, I got the impression that not every <em>customization</em> is necessary for having a well-functioning vehicle, but if I take away the fancy, unnecessary extras, the <em>engineers</em> are doing a damn well job. This is what we are going to do: <em>customize</em> our <em>car</em>, maybe a little bit too much, and after driving it a little, we are going to add new or remove existing extras in order to have a very good <em>car</em>. The show has the following chapters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Introduction of the <em>car</em> owner, and her situation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meeting, where the <em>engineers</em> discuss the customization - similar to a planning meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assembling the <em>car *- short session about how the *engineers</em> are building the <em>car</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The showdown - the <em>engineers</em> present the <em>car</em> to the owner - explain what they have built and for what purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test drive</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before starting the actual post, I would like to thank <a href="http://www.danpink.com/">Daniel H. Pink</a> and <a href="http://hhgttg.de/blog/">Olaf Lewitz</a> for their insights on <em>demo cancellation</em> and <em>rewarding systems</em>, which topics will be presented shortly.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h2>

<p>The first time I was thinking about <strong>improving the situation</strong> was the end of last October. At that time I was busy working in a firefighting team, which was responsible for solving the bugs of our old and new features. Firefighting is a very time consuming activity, so I didn’t have too much time to check on the other teams. The only thing I observed, though, was the amount of <em>demo cancellation</em> mails. <em>Demo cancellation</em> is supposed to be a tragedy in the life of a <a href="/blog/tag/scrum/">Scrum</a> team. It means that the team has not completed what it committed to, and cannot or won’t present the result of the <a href="/blog/tag/sprint">sprint</a> to the customers.</p>

<p>I remember my first demo cancellation. I had to explain the situation to a member of the top management, and the whole team was ashamed of their failure. While I was reading the previously mentioned mails, I looked at the teams and didn’t observe any change in their behaviour or their way of working. I accepted this - it took me a lot of time, believe me - and then I talked to team members, who - besides mentioning external impediments - told me that they have quality issues. They found bugs too late, and they didn’t have time to fix them before the demo.</p>

<p>We had several <a href="/blog/2010/08/agile-corner/">agile corner</a> sessions, and even though the quality issues were discussed, nothing really happened. At least not the things I would have liked to see. As a last resort, I was going to turn to a “<em>motivation by money</em>” solution: in case of a <em>demo cancellation</em>, the team would get less bonus. But luckily, before I did that, I talked to Daniel and Olaf, who pointed out that this wouldn’t solve the current issue. They suggested that instead of having any other similar “<em>bright</em>” ideas - they used a different terminology, I’m just being sarcastic with myself -, I should dig deeper and find the root cause of the quality issues.</p>

<p>I dug deeper, and I believe I have found it. Found <em>them</em>, actually:</p>

<p>Quality:
  Testing related:</p>

<pre><code>  - Colleagues with testing skills do [*checking*](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking/) in 95% of the sprint, they do actual testing in 5%, which eventually leads to finding bugs at the end of the sprint

  - Sometimes the teams were doing *checking* only at the end of the sprint, or in the next sprint

  - The team is occupied with writing high level test cases (similar to [BDD](http://behaviour-driven.org/), but more complicated and fragile), which consumes a tremendous amount of time, and leaves practically no time for [exploratory testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing)   Craftsmanship related:

  - Lack of discipline. On paper, we are following [eXtreme Programming](/blog/tag/xp/) engineering practices, but when the deadline is close, no more XP

  - A small group of developers don't want to do *testing*, not even *checking*

  - Lack of professional knowledge
</code></pre>

<p>Organization related:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Interesting team setup. One large team for a feature consisting of two virtual teams for one feature. This leads to the scenario when “<em>the **left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priorities are changing almost on weekly basis, it is hard to handle them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Different kind of work items from different independent sources</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unnecessary pressure from management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Turning back to the <strong>pimping</strong> metaphor, this <em>car</em> definitely needed <em>customizing</em>. At that time I had less influence on them, although I had some ideas on what needed to be changed - not the rewarding system of course. Unfortunately, the teams were busy with different activities, and there was no time to stop for a moment and do the <em>customization</em>. Fortunately, the reorganization made it happen: there is only one team now, which <a href="/blog/2010/06/handle-additional-resources/">forming</a> team consists of senior developers, developers, testers and new colleagues (local and foreign). I still believe that <a href="/blog/2010/11/kanban-nightmares/">every beginner/forming team needs a start kick</a>, but <strong>afterwards, the team itself is going to <em>customize</em> its way of working</strong>. Let’s start the <em>pimping</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-kick-off-meeting">The Kick-Off Meeting</h2>

<p>The team is in a bad situation. Its current way of working, which is <a href="/blog/tag/scrum/">Scrum</a>, does not provide the necessary tools for handling the <em>quality</em> and <em>organizational</em> problems at the same time. <em>Scrum</em> isn’t the only practice available, we could also use <a href="/blog/tag/lean">Lean</a> (<em>Scrum</em> wouldn’t disappear completely, we would keep doing <em>demo</em>s and <em>retrospective</em>s). It may help us solving the <em>organization</em> related issues, but we need something for the <em>quality</em> issues as well. On paper, we are doing <a href="/blog/tag/xp/">eXtreme Programming</a>, why not continue it and do it correctly?</p>

<p>So, <em>Lean</em> and <em>XP</em>. <em>Lean</em> has great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Lean_principles">principles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Lean_software_practices">practices</a>, but we need a system which puts together these principles and practices with the software engineering practices of XP. <a href="/blog/tag/kanban/">Kanban</a> seems to be a good choice, so we’ll go with that. It will show us and others our workflow, will helps us limit our resources, and deliver results faster and in better quality.</p>

<p>I’m talking about my <em>Scrum -&gt; XP+Kanban</em> transition in this <a href="/blog/2011/02/xp-with-kanban-instead-of-scrum/">post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-assembly">The Assembly</h2>

<p>The <em>assembly</em> in our case starts with <strong>education</strong>. It is really hard to do something when crucial lexical knowledge is missing. I observed that even if someone had the desire to learn something new, the next step, such as actually starting learning, did not happen. This has been a problem before, and since that mentioned lexical knowledge is really necessary for our success, we are going to do <em>guided education</em>. This means that there are certain articles that the team members will have to read, certain videos they will have to watch and certain exercises they will have to do, until that desire turns into action. <strong>I think eduction will make more difference than taking away the bonus or punishing the team with different old fashioned corporate methods.</strong></p>

<p>Now we have a **three plus seven rule **(rules in agile, it is an interesting contradiction). This means that every single team member has to read three technical or agile related articles and do seven <a href="/blog/tag/kata/">coding kata</a>s in a month. I admit that it is a bit harsh, but we’ll see on the next <a href="/blog/tag/retrospective/">retrospective</a> how the team members like this idea.</p>

<p>Additionally, every new concept such as system thinking, lean thinking, delivery on <a href="/blog/tag/demand">demand</a>, etc. is going to be explained and discussed, if necessary, several times, until everything is crystal clear to everyone.</p>

<p>For example, we’ll watch the following presentations together in order to have an idea on the new methodologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/poppendieck-lean-2007">Mary and Tom Poppendieck on using Lean for Competitive Advantage</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/video/anderson">LESS: Bringing Excellence to Service Delivery by David J. Anderson</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Single-Piece-Flow-Kanban">Single Piece Flow in Kanban: A How-To</a> (I’ll come back to the presentation later)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, everyone has to read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416">eXtreme Programming Explained</a> book by <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a>, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">wikipedia version</a>. We are going to do XP, so we have to know what  it is about.</p>

<p><em>Eduction</em> is not a one time only thing for us. We’ll do it continuously.</p>

<p>The next step is the <em>mindset change</em>. You cannot change people, they have to change themselves. However, you can change the environment, so that they have adapt to it, which induces that they will change themselves. The previously mentioned <em>Lean</em> principles are a great start for such a change. <em>Mary Poppendick</em> and <em>David J. Anderson</em> describe why changes are important in order to be better at what we are doing. I won’t repeat their thoughts from the presentations above, but I’m going to pick a couple of them which we are going to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Train ourselves in order to reduce waste (only do what needs to be done at the moment, have the smallest inventory possible, only work on items, which are known 100%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove impediments as soon as they show up (for example: we won’t ignore a failed build, or take care of bugs later)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ll take care of each other, the product, and follow our disciplines</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The components are here, now all that left is to assemble them into a <em>customized (pimped)</em> Kanban board:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-without-items.png" width="500" height="304" title="pimped kanban board without items" /></p>

<h2 id="the-showdown">The Showdown</h2>

<p>The Kanban board looks very complicated, and actually it is complicated. Due to the nature of Kanban systems - they require an existing process -, they are as complicated as the underlying processes. The team has to handle several scenarios, but I’m pretty sure that later on our board will be less complicated than it is now (it happened with my former firefighting team, where we started with 3 different Kanban boards, and about 13 columns, and ended up with one Kanban board and 6 columns).</p>

<p>The Kanban board has the following small <em>customizations</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2011/01/visualize-wf-dod/">A definition of done line</a> - make it clear what needs to be done</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2010/06/more-kanban-numbers/">WIP limit for avatars</a> - reducing context switching</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2010/10/internal-done-columns/">Internal done columns</a> - implementing a <em>pull</em> system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2010/09/ageing-items-on-the-board/">Age indication of certain items</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Series of <a href="/blog/2010/05/basics-of-code-review/">code review</a> steps (part of every <em>DoD</em>, and a separate phase in case of <em>Bugs)</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Different colours for different kinds of items. They make the Kanban board more informative, and they also help with statistics generation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After removing a couple of cells and columns from the Kanban board…</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-only-with-swim-lanes1.png" width="500" height="276" title="pimped kanban board only with swim lanes" /></p>

<p>…it seems less complicated. Usually, Kanban boards have columns, but there is nothing against having <em>horizontal column</em>s, in other words: <em>swim lane</em>s. They fit better into our way of working at the moment.</p>

<p>So the <em>swim lane</em>s indicate that the team has to…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>…solve <em>feature</em> <em>bugs</em>, usually introduced by the team during development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>…do <em>development</em> work -  sometimes fix legacy bugs, this case we won’t differentiate between these two</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>…do work which is completely <em>unrelated to development</em>, like setting up servers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Lean</em> principle requires that we eliminate every possible problem when they show up. The team wants to focus on the <em>bugs</em>, because there are many, and these bugs were in fact what started the whole story: remember the <em>demo cancellation?</em> It was a long time ago, wasn’t it? So if a bug shows up, the team will handle it as a top priority.</p>

<p>Since the team is a development team, it is supposed to do development, and expend less effort on <em>non-development related</em> matters. Of course a <em>non-development item</em> can be an <a href="http://leanandkanban.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/classes-of-service-and-policies/">intangible item</a>, in which case it can be handled with a higher priority.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s have a short interruption. An <em>intangible item</em> is a <em>class of service type</em>, and it has been introduced by <em>David J. Anderson</em>. It has no immediate or customer value, but a couple of them can have a huge effect on <a href="/blog/2013/07/lead-time">lead time</a>. For example, a build system improvement is an <em>intangible item</em>, but after implementing it, a faster build can reduce lead time, which means that the team can release faster and earn more money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every <em>swim lane</em> has its <a href="http://leanandkanban.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/wip-and-limits/">WIP limit</a>, and the whole system has a separate limit: <strong>7</strong>. There are 9 members in the team, and they don’t want to do a lot of context switching, so the overall capacity of the team is limited to 7 ongoing items at one time. For example, the team members are working on 2 <em>bugs</em>, 2 <em>non-development</em> items, and 3 <em>development</em> items. In this case, even though the <em>development WIP limit</em> is 4, nobody can start working on development, because 2+2+3=7, in other words: the team has got a full plate.</p>

<p>The Test column has the limit <strong>1</strong>. We had problems with testing and quality. Now the goal is to do a lot of testing, which hopefully will reduce the number of bugs found after the <em>demo</em> or <em>release</em>. The idea is that the whole <a href="/blog/tag/value-stream-mapping">flow</a> needs to be blocked until the latest item is not tested. And that the WIP limit will guarantee. Let’s assume that we allow 2 items in this column. It can happen, then, that one of the items remains there, and <a href="/blog/2010/09/ageing-items-on-the-board/">starts ageing</a>. We don’t want to let that happen. After learning more discipline, this strict limit won’t be necessary, but it will be just fine for the moment.</p>

<p>The phases of the <em>Bugs</em> <em>swim lane</em> is pretty straightforward, unlike the phases of the <em>Development swim lane:</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-developement-focus.png" width="500" height="278" title="kanban board developement focus" /></p>

<p>Another <em>swim lane</em> showed up: <em>Active item</em>s with a WIP limit <strong>2</strong>. This limit does not count into any previously mentioned WIP limits. It just limits the number of large items the team is working on. In the example above, there are two large items: ‘<em>A</em>’ and ‘<em>B</em>’. Large means that the item cannot be finished in 5 days. For example an <em>epic user story</em> is considered a large item<em>.</em> Besides its WIP limit, the <em>Active items</em> is just a visualization aid.</p>

<p>The life-cycle of an item will help to understand the separate columns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When a new work item enters the system, it is placed in the <em>Queue</em> column</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a <em>development item</em> and somebody can work on it (the WIP limits allow it), that person will put it into the <em>Dec./T.P</em> column</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Dec.</em> means <em>Decomposition</em>, and <em>T.P.</em> means <em>Test Plan</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>During <em>decomposition</em> the team checks the new item, we understand what the work is about, and if necessary, break down the item into smaller items (in scrum terminology, splitting into smaller user stories), that can be done within 5 working days (inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/papachrismatts">Chris Matts</a>’ Kanban board from <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/mattiasskarin/2010/12/03/1291361993216.html">Mattias Skarin’s collection</a>). For example: <em>A = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we know exactly what the work is about - remember: we start working only on those items which we know 100% -, we will plan how to test it: acceptance test cases, <a href="/blog/tag/bdd">BDD</a> test cases, Junit test cases etc. This will be the ‘<em>+1’</em>. We also plan which regression test cases need to be executed, they are the ‘<em>N’. *For example, if the *item</em> changes a certain dialog, we won’t execute every test case during development, but only those related to that dialog</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the work item is decomposed and a test plan is available, we put it into the <em>Development Queue. *The contents of the *Dec. / T.P and Dev. Queue</em> columns do not count into the WIP limit the <em>development swim lane</em>, because they haven’t been started yet. From this point we do our coding on a <em>developer branch</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Green b. *means *Green base</em>. <strong>We are doing green to green integration</strong>, which means that all the test cases we have are green before we start to work on something, and after finishing it, they are still <span style="color: #008000;">green</span>. This ensures that the new functionality doesn’t break the old ones. In this step we run the ‘<em>N’</em> test cases, planned during <em>Dec./T.P.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>XP Code</em> is Extreme Programming coding. This is the only column where actual development is done. The name of the column is a bit misleading, but it indicates that we are seriously doing the XP techniques in this phase. We also develop the ‘<em>+1</em>’ test case(s) in this phase. If we find out that our change has effect on other parts of our application, we extend the Test Plan with ‘<em>M’</em> test cases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Refactoring</em> is straightforward. We refactor our changes in order to improve quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Green b.</em> again. This is the <em>…to green</em> part of green to green. In this phase we execute the ‘<em>N+M+1</em>’ test cases, and if they are green, then we have made sure that the new functionality is working (<em>+1</em>), and it hasn’t broken the old ones (<em>N+M</em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <em>Merge</em> phase we merge our development branch to our release branch. The new functionality is ready for more testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <em>Test</em> phase, we run the ‘<em>N+M+1’</em> test cases again. It could happen that another item had been finished earlier, for example ‘<em>A2</em>’ before ‘<em>A1</em>’. In this case, the ‘<em>N+M+1</em>’ for ‘<em>A1</em>’ is no longer valid, because ‘<em>A2</em>’ changed the underlying system. We have to extend the test cases of ‘<em>A1</em>’ with the appropriate test cases of ‘<em>A2</em>’. Additionally we do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">exploratory testing</a> in this phase.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If we find a new **</strong>bug<strong>** or a missing functionality during development<em>,</em> they will be written as a new item, put in their proper queue **</strong>and prioritized accordingly<strong>**. **Bugs go to the main <em>Queue</em> on the left, and missing functionality items into the <em>Dev. Queue</em> in the middle.</strong> Every discovered thing deserves its separate item**.</p>

<p>There is a red border between <em>Refactoring</em> and <em>Green b.</em> If someone worked on an item on the left side of this border - mainly planning and implementation -, she is not allowed to work on it on the right side - testing. This move ensures an objective testing perspective. This is also valid for code review. <strong>No one is allowed to review or test the item she had been previously working on</strong>.</p>

<p>Again, it is complicated, but it will be less complicated after a couple of weeks or months.</p>

<p>The first Kanban board picture has three cells, which haven’t been discussed yet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Demo ready</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demo queue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Other</em> is easy. A small place for notes, placeholder for pens etc.</p>

<p>We present our results to our customers, managers and colleagues. One of our main goals is to show only working and bug-free items to them. After doing our complicated development flow, we want to do more testing. The plan is to have <em>demo meeting</em>s every three weeks. This is our release cycle. Every item integrated one week prior to the <em>demo meeting</em> goes to the <em>Demo ready</em> cell. Those which are implemented during the week just before the demo go to the <em>Demo queue</em> cell. We won’t bring them to the <em>demo meeting</em>, because we are going to do another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">exploratory testing</a> session on* <em>the content of the *Demo ready</em> cell. Bugs discovered during this testing session have the highest priority, because the product is integrated, and we’ve missed something important even with our complicated development workflow.</p>

<p>The <em>Demo queue</em> cell is for the items finished during that one week period before the demo. After the <em>demo meeting</em>, its content is moved to the <em>Demo ready</em> cell, and the cycle continues.</p>

<p>We have continuous integration build, which executes a static code checker, builds the source code and runs the unit tests. When this build fails, we put a paper on the Kanban board with the text: <strong>build failed!</strong> like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-build-failed.png" width="500" height="249" title="kanban board build failed" /></p>

<p>We are following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way">5th principle of TPS</a>: if the build fails, we stop doing whatever we are doing at the moment and fix the build. The paper indicates the problem, and since it is all over the board, it makes it difficult to change its contents.</p>

<h2 id="test-drive">Test Drive</h2>

<p>Let’s do a test drive with our new <em>car:</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-test-drive-1.png" width="500" height="248" title="kanban board test drive 1" /></p>

<p>The team has two <em>development items</em>: ‘<em>A</em>’, ‘<em>B</em>’ and one <em>non-development item</em> ‘<em>D</em>’.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-test-drive-2.png" width="500" height="248" title="kanban board test drive 2" /></p>

<p>Two of the team members have started decomposing and test planning item ‘<em>A</em>’. ‘<em>A1</em>’, ‘<em>A2</em>’ and ‘<em>A3</em>’ have been created.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-test-drive-3.png" width="500" height="247" title="kanban board test drive 3" /></p>

<p>‘A1’ has been implemented, integrated and tested, so far so good. But a bug - ‘<em>A21</em>’ - has been found, while refactoring ‘<em>A2</em>’. ‘<em>A21</em>’ has been moved to the top of our <em>Queue</em>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-test-drive-4.png" width="500" height="248" title="kanban board test drive 4" /></p>

<p>‘<em>A2</em>’ remains where it is, because it is blocked by ‘<em>A21</em>’. Two of the team members are working on ‘<em>A21</em>’, meanwhile the third member starts decomposing ‘<em>B</em>’. She has chosen ‘<em>B</em>’ over ‘<em>A3</em>’, because she is familiar with ‘<em>B</em>’ and has the feeling that if ‘<em>A2</em>’ is problematic, this may mean that ‘<em>A3</em>’ is also problematic. If she started working on ‘<em>A3</em>’, then her implementation efforts might be wasted.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-test-drive-5.png" width="500" height="248" title="kanban board test drive 5" /></p>

<p>‘<em>A21</em>’ has been solved and tested, ‘<em>A2</em>’ can move on. Meanwhile, the decomposition of ‘<em>B</em>’ has been finished: it turned out to be a small item, so there is no need to split. Additionally, two team members have started to work on ‘<em>A3</em>’. Unfortunately, a bug has shown up with ‘<em>A2</em>’ during <em>Green b</em>: ‘<em>A22</em>’. It is placed on the top of the <em>Queue</em>. ‘<em>A2</em>’ is stopped again.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2011-02-06-pimp-my-team/kanban-board-test-drive-6.png" width="500" height="249" title="kanban board test drive 6" /></p>

<p>Two members are fixing ‘<em>A22</em>’, ‘<em>A3</em>’ is continued by one member, and ‘<em>A2</em>’ is still stopped.</p>

<p>Now you can have an idea about how this works.</p>

<h2 id="closure">Closure</h2>

<p>Again, I have to admit that our new way of working is really complicated. I put a lot of trust in the education, and hope that things like green to green integration and lean principles will become a part of our daily lives, and we won’t need complicated processes forcing ourselves to do them properly. <em>Kanban</em> and <em>XP</em> will help us to solve our quality issues (see the root cause collection at the beginning of this post), and the <em>Lean</em> thinking will solve the organizational ones.</p>

<p>James Shore and Arlo Belshee describe a similar setup in their <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Single-Piece-Flow-Kanban">Single Piece Flow in Kanban</a> presentation. Actually, I felt that I’ve reinvented the wheel after watching the presentation. I liked what James and Arlo have presented, but we need more time and practice in order to do everything the way they say is right. So we are going to stick with the way of working described in this post for a while.</p>

<p>We are living our lives with this setup for almost three weeks now, and there have already been a couple of small changes and new ideas, but those I’m going to share in a different post. I hope you’ve read some useful ideas. If you have any thoughts on the subject, please use the comment section for sharing them.</p>
