In retrospect, I didn't spend too much time on explaining why, because it had a very loose connection to the subject of the talk, and I assumed that the audience would understand what I meant anyway.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

At that time I thought that electronic boards were evil - kill communication&nbsp;and&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;-, but I decided to give a try to their suggestion: use the physical board for tracking and collaboration, and use the electronic board for administration.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>
