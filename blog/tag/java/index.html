Usually, it is a bad idea to introduce mocks in cucumber scenarios, because they are supposed to test the whole system as it is, however there are cases when mocking comes in handy: for example, a module or component of your system communicates with a 3rd party system.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>
