If you have ever been to an agile workshop or&nbsp;conference, you may have already heard this expression. Software craftsmen sharpen their saw at coding dojos&nbsp;where they talk to each other a talk about new things or do Kata exercises together.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

I was really looking forward to this event because of two reasons: first, it was held in my hometown Miskolc, Hungary at the University where I studied and work, and second, I finally saw a chance to tell students about recent software development methods, because I knew that this topic wasn't covered in their&nbsp;curriculum.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

Most software engineers and craftsmen aren't that interested in how to deliver faster, or how to communicate better, they are interested in how to be better at their profession: programming.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

Then I got into an interesting discussion where the topic was that the customer does not pay for tests, she pays for a working software.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>
