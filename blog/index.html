Therefore I was looking for something that can show me quickly the current status of the project and this kind of risk. I started to use a portfolio Kanban board that covers the whole project, but my board is different from Pawel Brodzinski's resource oriented board: I'm using an old idea from Chris Matts - a work item is put into a column that tells us when the it is supposed to be ready -, and the idea of organisational level Kanban boards.<br /><br />more...</span></a></article></li>

For example, with a CONWIP of 6 we can have at most 6 work items between ‘todo' and ‘done'. Like throughtput, takt time, and flow efficiency CONWIP comes from the car manufacturing world and it was designed for a system that produces the same kind of work item over and over.<br /><br />more...</span></a></article></li>

Let's assume that you have a working pull system which means that the team members don't push the work on others, but others can take the work if they are capable to handle them (I'm not using the word free on purpose because what if somebody can work on two things in parallel).<br /><br />more...</span></a></article></li>

It is definitely not to replace the Waterfall development process, or make the life of middle managers even more difficult. I believe it is not about testing more or using new technology either.

It shows the elapsed time between two completely assembled cars leaving the factory floor. If the takt time is 2 hours, it means that the factory produces 12 cars a day (24h/2h = 12). With the use of takt time people in car manufacturing can detect problems in production earlier.<br /><br />more...</span></a></article></li>
