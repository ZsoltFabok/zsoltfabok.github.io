I love them because I can hardly imagine any improvement without them. I hate them because they occur periodically, they are always about problems and rarely about pure improvements (pure means to me that we improve because we just want to be faster, and not because we have a problem that slows us down and we want it to get solved).<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

In retrospect, I didn't spend too much time on explaining why, because it had a very loose connection to the subject of the talk, and I assumed that the audience would understand what I meant anyway.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

They are very useful separately, but when one uses them together, they may lead to problems which nobody wants to deal with at all.

At that time I thought that electronic boards were evil - kill communication&nbsp;and&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;-, but I decided to give a try to their suggestion: use the physical board for tracking and collaboration, and use the electronic board for administration.<br/><br/>more...</span></a></article></li>

A common practice for that is to have a Kanban board where the proper phases are visualized.

In scrum, it is&nbsp;advised&nbsp;to have cross-functional teams. This advice is unfortunately sometimes interpreted in the wrong way.
